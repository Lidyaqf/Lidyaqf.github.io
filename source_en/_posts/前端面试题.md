<details>
  <summary><strong>Differences between var, let, and const?</strong></summary>

#### ‚úÖ Scope

1. Variables declared with `var` do not have block scope. **They can be accessed outside blocks but not outside functions**.
2. Variables declared with `let` have block scope, **accessible only within the declared block**.
3. `const` defines constants, **must be initialized, accessible only in the declared block, and cannot be reassigned**.

#### ‚úÖ Declaration Rules

- A variable name can only be declared once using one of these methods; otherwise, it throws an error.

#### ‚úÖ Difference when using with `this`

| Feature | var / let / const |
|--------|--------------------|
| Can change `this` context | ‚úÖ Yes |
| First parameter is the object `this` refers to | ‚úÖ Yes |
| No object or `undefined/null` | Defaults to global `window` |
| Parameter passing | `apply` uses array, `call` uses parameter list, `bind` supports multiple arguments |
| Execution method | `apply/call` execute immediately, `bind` returns a new function |

  <summary><strong>What is event delegation?</strong></summary>

- Event delegation attaches events to a parent or ancestor element instead of individual child elements.<br/>
- When the event reaches the target element, it bubbles up and triggers the handler on the outer element.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Difference between debounce and throttle?</strong></summary>

- **Debounce**: Executes only the last trigger. Even if the event keeps firing, it waits until `n` seconds after the last event to execute.
- **Throttle**: Controls the execution frequency. Fires every `n` seconds during continuous event triggers.

  <summary><strong>How does frontend prevent SQL injection?</strong></summary>

1. **Parameterized Queries**: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
2. **Input Validation**: Ensure user input follows expected format.
3. **Escape Special Characters**: Escape characters when constructing SQL queries.
4. **Limit Permissions**: Restrict user privileges to prevent unsafe operations.
5. **Whitelist Validation**: Only allow expected values in input.
6. **Code Review**: Regularly review code, especially DB-related parts.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Difference between HTTP and HTTPS</strong></summary>

1. HTTPS requires a certificate from a CA, which may cost money.
2. HTTP transmits data in plaintext, while HTTPS uses SSL encryption.
3. They use different connection methods and ports: HTTP uses 80, HTTPS uses 443.
4. HTTP is stateless; HTTPS combines SSL + HTTP for encrypted, authenticated, secure communication.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Difference between created and mounted?</strong></summary>

- `created` runs before `mounted`. DOM is not fully rendered, but API requests can be made early here.
- `mounted` is triggered when the DOM has been rendered, so it's suitable for manipulating DOM elements.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Explain the event loop mechanism</strong></summary>

### üîÅ What is the Event Loop?

JavaScript is single-threaded. In addition to the **call stack**, it relies on **task queues** to control asynchronous code execution order.

This whole process is called the **Event Loop**.

### üß† Core Concepts

- Only one event loop in a single thread.
- Multiple task queues:
  - **Macro Tasks**
  - **Micro Tasks**

---

### ‚è± Execution Order

> **Macro Task ‚ûù Clear all Micro Tasks ‚ûù Next Macro Task ‚ûù Clear all Micro Tasks...**

1. Execute a macro task (like the whole script)
2. Execute all micro tasks created during this macro task
3. If micro tasks generate more micro tasks, execute them too
4. Begin the next macro task loop

---

### üß© Examples of Macro Tasks

- `script`
- `setTimeout`
- `setInterval`
- `setImmediate` (Node.js)
- `I/O operations`
- `UI rendering`

### üß¨ Examples of Micro Tasks

- `process.nextTick` (Node.js, higher priority)
- `Promise.then / catch / finally`
- `async / await`
- `MutationObserver`

  <summary><strong>Explain the CSS box model</strong></summary>

The CSS box model includes IE and standard W3C models.

- In **standard W3C box model**, `width` only includes content. `box-sizing: content-box` (default).
- In **IE box model**, `width` includes content + padding + border. `box-sizing: border-box`.
- `box-sizing: padding-box` includes left/right padding + width.

  <summary><strong>Differences between Vue 2 and Vue 3</strong></summary>

1. Two-way binding:
   - Vue 2: uses `Object.defineProperty()` (ES5), which only watches individual properties.
   - Vue 3: uses `Proxy` (ES6), which can observe entire objects and arrays.
2. Lifecycle hooks:
   - Vue 2: `beforeCreate`, `created`, `beforeMount`, `mounted`, etc.
   - Vue 3: `setup`, `onBeforeMount`, `onMounted`, etc.
3. Vue 2 requires a root tag; Vue 3 allows multiple root tags via Fragment.
4. API:
   - Vue 2: Options API (functions and data handled separately).
   - Vue 3: Composition API (related code grouped together).
5. Slots:
   - Named slot: Vue 2 uses `slot=""`, Vue 3 uses `v-slot=""`.
   - Scoped slot: Vue 2 uses `slot-scope="data"`, Vue 3 uses `#data` or `#default="{data}"`.
