## Aunt Tai

Aunt Tai is strong-willed and resilient. Her optimistic attitude is something worth learning from. The greatest thing my father ever did was marrying my mother—a truly great woman. A real woman should face everything with positivity and build the future she desires with her own hands.

Although she resorted to stealing, it was driven by hardship—survival and family. Setting aside pride to do things against her will is, in a way, a form of strength. It’s not about crying and making a scene, but staying proactive in adversity.

Thinking about it, the author's achievements are inseparable from his great mother.

Ah, that lovely mother! To preserve her husband's dignity and happiness, she insisted on completing the house. Isn’t that a form of strength too? To follow her heart courageously is truly admirable.

In fact, the person who understands my father the most is my mother. She knows his pride. Isn’t this what love is? You don’t need to say it—I understand. I understand you, and you understand me, and that’s why we’ve been together for so long.

## Zhang Meili

Get up from where you fell. Zhang Meili seems like someone who pursued true love and worked hard for what she desired. Though she was eventually forced to liberate herself sexually, I still respect her for everything she once did.

Public opinion is powerful, but Zhang Meili’s inner strength is even more powerful.
