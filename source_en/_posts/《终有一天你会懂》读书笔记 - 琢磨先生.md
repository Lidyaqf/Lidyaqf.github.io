The book does contain a lot of his own "biases," but I find him authentic and humorous. His language is simple and understandable, and each subtitle essentially tells us what we should do.

## Understanding Life
Life is never about what you want it to be. It's good to discover beauty and to view things from others' perspectives. At the same time, one should have self-awareness.

## Understanding Love
Sheldon once said: "The pursuit of another human to spend life with is something I've never understood. Maybe I'm too interesting to need company. So I wish you the same joy with each other as I have with myself."
One can never escape loneliness through another person; only through passion for life. Managing a relationship requires rationality. Freedom is inalienable. I once checked my ex's phone—I realized it was wrong and won't do it again.

## Understanding Strategy
This section mainly introduces the strategies of courting and how to maintain a good relationship—true wisdom. Never sacrifice your career for family. Don’t live with in-laws (though I think it depends). Have your own hobbies.

## Understanding Marriage
Endure and stay loyal. As for non-marriage beliefs, there's nothing more to say.

## Understanding Setbacks
Every breakup is just making way for true love. Don't force it. I love you, so I wish you well, even if I'm not the one by your side.
Do what you want regardless of others' opinions. Only care about those who matter to you.

## Understanding Reading
What, Why, How. Keep reading. Don’t chase speed, but depth.

## Understanding Romance
He shares sweet daily stories with his wife. If you don't break up, you won’t discover how many better people there are out there. If you find one—lucky. If not—you can still live happily on your own.
Live with emotional intelligence and the world becomes beautiful.

## Understanding Socializing
Associate with decent people. Different people require different approaches. Rejecting others is an art. If you don't have the guts to ask for your money back, don't lend it.

## Understanding Human Nature
I tend to be skeptical about human nature. You can't control others, so just manage yourself. Don’t be vulgar.

## Understanding Good and Evil
Some people enter your life just to teach you a lesson. Good or evil—I prefer believing in others, as trust is given before it's earned.
Even if deceived, it’s a lesson learned—don’t fall into the same trap again. But don’t stop trusting altogether; kind people still exist.
God made the right hand a right hand as a reward; same for kind people—kindness is its own reward.
I recall being in a restroom without tissue once. I was going to ask a friend, but a stranger overheard and handed me tissues. Such kindness moved me deeply.
Kindness must come with principles—otherwise it may hurt others or yourself.

## Understanding Wealth
The poor stay poor because of narrow thinking. To get rich, don’t just invest in your body—think bigger. See the essence of problems.
Time is limited—how to get rich fast? Find a subject you love, apply it, think broadly, and work in fields closely tied to society.

## Understanding Society
Have ambition. Take one step at a time. Build an independent personality. Be accountable for your actions. Learn to transform your ability to feel happiness—then change yourself.

## Understanding Life and Death
Death studies include concepts like: No death, no life; face death to live; understand death to be reborn. Interesting and thought-provoking.
Knowing that we will die is what pushes us to live fully. When the time comes, I think I’ll embrace death.

> What the world lacks isn't perfect people, but justice, sincerity, courage, and compassion from the heart. — My biggest takeaway after watching *Forever Young* today.
> We all know cause and effect—but causes and effects come from relationships. Someday, I’ll read Schopenhauer and Nietzsche properly.

## Understanding Travel
This part recounts Mr. Zhuomo’s experiences in Tibet. Many dream of going there—maybe because it helps people truly understand life’s struggles.
The US is less disciplined than the UK. Japan has great food culture and says “sorry” a lot—avoiding bothering others.

## Understanding Career
First learn to endure hardship. Then understand yourself and your talents. Begin with the end in mind and stay focused.

## Understanding Education
Every child is born pure. Without proper education, they won’t become pillars of the nation.

## Understanding Entertainment & Freedom
Life has two paths: one for career ambition—keep passion; the other for living warmly—keep humanity.
Open your eyes each day and tell yourself: Oh yeah!
