    <title>GitLab CI/CD</title>
    <url>/2025/04/10/gitlabci/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[GitLab CI&#x2F;CD Guide for Frontend Projects (Mac Environment)OverviewIn daily development, we often manually send the built dist package to the backend for deployment, which is inefficient and error-prone. CI (Continuous Integration) automates this process. This guide shows how to use GitLab CI to implement continuous integration and deployment.

1. Install GitLab RunnerRefer to the official documentation: GitLab Runner Installation Guide

2. Register Runner Locally
Open your GitLab project page and go to Settings → CI&#x2F;CD, expand the Runners section.
Note the displayed URL and token for registration.

Run the registration commandgitlab-runner register

Follow the prompts and enter the following information:

GitLab CI Coordinator URL: https://gitlab.com
GitLab CI Token: xxx (copy from the project)
Tags: my-tag,another-tag (custom tags)
Description: my-runner (custom description)
Executor: shell (recommended on Mac)

After registration, return to the GitLab CI&#x2F;CD settings page. If the runner status is green, it’s running successfully. If not, start the runner manually:
gitlab-runner run


3. Create and Commit .gitlab-ci.ymlSave the following content as .gitlab-ci.yml and push it to GitLab:
stages:  - deploydeploy_to_test:  stage: deploy  script:    - yarn    - rm -rf dist/    - yarn build    - ls -l -t ./dist/    - rsync -avz ./dist/ root@xxx.xx.xx.xxx:/dist


This CI script builds the project and uses rsync to deploy the dist folder to a remote server.


4. CI with Docker (Optional)If you want a more comprehensive CI&#x2F;CD pipeline using Docker, follow these steps:
1. Install Docker (Mac)brew install --cask docker

2. Pull GitLab Imagedocker pull drud/gitlab-ce:v0.29.1

3. Create GitLab Containerdocker run -d -p 8443:443 -p 8090:80 -p 8022:22 --restart always --name gitlab drud/gitlab-ce:v0.29.1

Explanation:

-p 8443:443: map HTTPS port
-p 8090:80: map HTTP port
-p 8022:22: map SSH port
--restart always: auto-restart on crash or reboot
--name gitlab: container named gitlab

Visit:
http://localhost:8090/


5. .gitlab-ci.yml Example for Docker Modevariables:  TEST_NAME: &quot;tips&quot;  OUT_PORT: &quot;8081&quot;  IN_PORT: &quot;8081&quot;stages:  - deploydeploy_to_test:  stage: deploy  before_script:    - if [ $(docker ps -aq --filter name=$CI_PROJECT_NAME) ]; then docker rm -f $CI_PROJECT_NAME; fi  script:    - docker build -f Dockerfile -t $TEST_NAME:latest .    - docker run -d -p $OUT_PORT:$IN_PORT --name $TEST_NAME $TEST_NAME:latest

After successful deployment, you can view the build process on the GitLab CI&#x2F;CD Pipelines page. A new container will be generated under the Containers section. Click the corresponding port to access the deployed page.

    <title>Sync Google Sheets Data Between Spreadsheets</title>
    <url>/2025/08/28/google%20sheet%E5%90%8C%E6%AD%A5%E8%A1%A8%E6%A0%BC%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[Sync Google Sheets Data Across Multiple SheetsThere is a requirement to synchronize all sheets from one Google Spreadsheet to another spreadsheet (including all sub-sheets).
This is implemented using Google Sheets → Extensions → Apps Script.
Why synchronization is neededThe source spreadsheet is read-only by default.By synchronizing its data into another spreadsheet, the copied sheets can then be edited freely.
sourceSpreadsheetId and targetSpreadsheetId are the IDs from the Google Sheets URL —they are the long strings after /d/ in the address bar.
Apps Script Code Examplefunction synchronizeSheetsToAnotherFile() &#123;  const sourceSpreadsheetId = &quot;id1&quot;;  const targetSpreadsheetId = &quot;id2&quot;;   // Example: 1NOtSSvDwXrca8vqyZW6OqQJwGaCICMVguSz1-i72oqg  const sourceSpreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(sourceSpreadsheetId);  const targetSpreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(targetSpreadsheetId);  const sourceSheets = sourceSpreadsheet.getSheets();  sourceSheets.forEach(sheet =&gt; &#123;    const sheetName = sheet.getName();    let targetSheet = targetSpreadsheet.getSheetByName(sheetName);    if (!targetSheet) &#123;      targetSheet = targetSpreadsheet.insertSheet(sheetName);    &#125; else &#123;      targetSheet.clear();    &#125;    const range = sheet.getDataRange();    const displayValues = range.getDisplayValues();     const formats = range.getBackgrounds();            const fontWeights = range.getFontWeights();        const targetRange = targetSheet.getRange(      1,      1,      displayValues.length,      displayValues[0].length    );    targetRange.setValues(displayValues);    targetRange.setBackgrounds(formats);    targetRange.setFontWeights(fontWeights);  &#125;);&#125;

    <title>Talking About Node RPC</title>
    <url>/2025/07/16/node-rpc/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
What Is SerializationData transmitted over a TCP channel can only be in binary form. So converting a data structure or an object into binary form is called serialization. The reverse process is called deserialization. The rules that define how they convert back and forth are called a protocol.

What Is RPCRPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. Most RPC systems are based on TCP. The general implementation flow is as follows:

The frontend calls the corresponding interface through a Proxy. The Proxy converts information such as the RPC service name, method name, and parameters into an RPC Request object and passes it to the RPC framework.
The RPC framework serializes the RPC Request object into binary form according to the RPC protocol.
The RPC framework sends the binary data to the backend through a TCP channel.
The backend deserializes the binary data back into an RPC Request object.
The backend maps the deserialized data to the actual method it implements, passes in the parameters, obtains the result, and then packages it into an RPC Response object for the RPC framework.
The RPC framework serializes the RPC Response object into binary form according to the RPC protocol and sends it back to the frontend through the TCP channel.
After receiving the binary data, the frontend deserializes it into an RPC Response object, and the Proxy returns the result to the business code.

    <url>/2025/12/02/js%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[JavaScript Basics Summary (Hoisting, Strict Mode)
Rules for Variable and Function Hoisting
Variable hoisting: Execution still happens in order; variable declarations are hoisted but assignments are not.
Function hoisting: The entire function body is hoisted to the top of its scope.
Priority: Function hoisting &gt; Variable hoisting.

console.log(a); // undefinedvar a = 2;foo(); // works normallyfunction foo() &#123;  console.log(&quot;Function hoisting succeeded&quot;);&#125;


Using Strict Mode with use strictWhat it does:
Prevents creating accidental global variables;
Disallows using undeclared variables, helping avoid memory leaks;
Binds this to undefined by default instead of window.

function foo() &#123;  &quot;use strict&quot;;  console.log(this.a); // ❌ TypeError&#125;var a = 2;foo(); // in strict mode, this is undefined, so this.a cannot be read


(function() &#123;  &quot;use strict&quot;;  foo(); // calling foo here doesn&#x27;t change its default binding&#125;)();function foo() &#123;  console.log(this.a);&#125;var a = 2;

    <content><![CDATA[The book does contain a lot of his own “biases,” but I find him authentic and humorous. His language is simple and understandable, and each subtitle essentially tells us what we should do.
Understanding LifeLife is never about what you want it to be. It’s good to discover beauty and to view things from others’ perspectives. At the same time, one should have self-awareness.
Understanding LoveSheldon once said: “The pursuit of another human to spend life with is something I’ve never understood. Maybe I’m too interesting to need company. So I wish you the same joy with each other as I have with myself.”One can never escape loneliness through another person; only through passion for life. Managing a relationship requires rationality. Freedom is inalienable. I once checked my ex’s phone—I realized it was wrong and won’t do it again.
Understanding StrategyThis section mainly introduces the strategies of courting and how to maintain a good relationship—true wisdom. Never sacrifice your career for family. Don’t live with in-laws (though I think it depends). Have your own hobbies.
Understanding MarriageEndure and stay loyal. As for non-marriage beliefs, there’s nothing more to say.
Understanding SetbacksEvery breakup is just making way for true love. Don’t force it. I love you, so I wish you well, even if I’m not the one by your side.Do what you want regardless of others’ opinions. Only care about those who matter to you.
Understanding ReadingWhat, Why, How. Keep reading. Don’t chase speed, but depth.
Understanding RomanceHe shares sweet daily stories with his wife. If you don’t break up, you won’t discover how many better people there are out there. If you find one—lucky. If not—you can still live happily on your own.Live with emotional intelligence and the world becomes beautiful.
Understanding SocializingAssociate with decent people. Different people require different approaches. Rejecting others is an art. If you don’t have the guts to ask for your money back, don’t lend it.
Understanding Human NatureI tend to be skeptical about human nature. You can’t control others, so just manage yourself. Don’t be vulgar.
Understanding Good and EvilSome people enter your life just to teach you a lesson. Good or evil—I prefer believing in others, as trust is given before it’s earned.Even if deceived, it’s a lesson learned—don’t fall into the same trap again. But don’t stop trusting altogether; kind people still exist.God made the right hand a right hand as a reward; same for kind people—kindness is its own reward.I recall being in a restroom without tissue once. I was going to ask a friend, but a stranger overheard and handed me tissues. Such kindness moved me deeply.Kindness must come with principles—otherwise it may hurt others or yourself.
Understanding WealthThe poor stay poor because of narrow thinking. To get rich, don’t just invest in your body—think bigger. See the essence of problems.Time is limited—how to get rich fast? Find a subject you love, apply it, think broadly, and work in fields closely tied to society.
Understanding SocietyHave ambition. Take one step at a time. Build an independent personality. Be accountable for your actions. Learn to transform your ability to feel happiness—then change yourself.
Understanding Life and DeathDeath studies include concepts like: No death, no life; face death to live; understand death to be reborn. Interesting and thought-provoking.Knowing that we will die is what pushes us to live fully. When the time comes, I think I’ll embrace death.

What the world lacks isn’t perfect people, but justice, sincerity, courage, and compassion from the heart. — My biggest takeaway after watching Forever Young today.We all know cause and effect—but causes and effects come from relationships. Someday, I’ll read Schopenhauer and Nietzsche properly.

Understanding TravelThis part recounts Mr. Zhuomo’s experiences in Tibet. Many dream of going there—maybe because it helps people truly understand life’s struggles.The US is less disciplined than the UK. Japan has great food culture and says “sorry” a lot—avoiding bothering others.
Understanding CareerFirst learn to endure hardship. Then understand yourself and your talents. Begin with the end in mind and stay focused.
Understanding EducationEvery child is born pure. Without proper education, they won’t become pillars of the nation.
Understanding Entertainment &amp; FreedomLife has two paths: one for career ambition—keep passion; the other for living warmly—keep humanity.Open your eyes each day and tell yourself: Oh yeah!

  Differences between var, let, and const?

✅ Scope
Variables declared with var do not have block scope. They can be accessed outside blocks but not outside functions.
Variables declared with let have block scope, accessible only within the declared block.
const defines constants, must be initialized, accessible only in the declared block, and cannot be reassigned.

✅ Declaration Rules
A variable name can only be declared once using one of these methods; otherwise, it throws an error.

✅ Difference when using with this


Feature
var &#x2F; let &#x2F; const



Can change this context
✅ Yes


First parameter is the object this refers to
✅ Yes


No object or undefined/null
Defaults to global window


Parameter passing
apply uses array, call uses parameter list, bind supports multiple arguments


Execution method
apply/call execute immediately, bind returns a new function





  What is event delegation?


Event delegation attaches events to a parent or ancestor element instead of individual child elements.
When the event reaches the target element, it bubbles up and triggers the handler on the outer element.




  Difference between debounce and throttle?


Debounce: Executes only the last trigger. Even if the event keeps firing, it waits until n seconds after the last event to execute.
Throttle: Controls the execution frequency. Fires every n seconds during continuous event triggers.




  How does frontend prevent SQL injection?


Parameterized Queries: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
Input Validation: Ensure user input follows expected format.
Escape Special Characters: Escape characters when constructing SQL queries.
Limit Permissions: Restrict user privileges to prevent unsafe operations.
Whitelist Validation: Only allow expected values in input.
Code Review: Regularly review code, especially DB-related parts.




  Difference between HTTP and HTTPS


HTTPS requires a certificate from a CA, which may cost money.
HTTP transmits data in plaintext, while HTTPS uses SSL encryption.
They use different connection methods and ports: HTTP uses 80, HTTPS uses 443.
HTTP is stateless; HTTPS combines SSL + HTTP for encrypted, authenticated, secure communication.




  Difference between created and mounted?


created runs before mounted. DOM is not fully rendered, but API requests can be made early here.
mounted is triggered when the DOM has been rendered, so it’s suitable for manipulating DOM elements.




  Explain the event loop mechanism

🔁 What is the Event Loop?JavaScript is single-threaded. In addition to the call stack, it relies on task queues to control asynchronous code execution order.
This whole process is called the Event Loop.
🧠 Core Concepts
Only one event loop in a single thread.
Multiple task queues:
Macro Tasks
Micro Tasks




⏱ Execution Order
Macro Task ➝ Clear all Micro Tasks ➝ Next Macro Task ➝ Clear all Micro Tasks…


Execute a macro task (like the whole script)
Execute all micro tasks created during this macro task
If micro tasks generate more micro tasks, execute them too
Begin the next macro task loop


🧩 Examples of Macro Tasks
script
setTimeout
setInterval
setImmediate (Node.js)
I/O operations
UI rendering

🧬 Examples of Micro Tasks
process.nextTick (Node.js, higher priority)
Promise.then / catch / finally
async / await
MutationObserver




  Explain the CSS box model

The CSS box model includes IE and standard W3C models.

In standard W3C box model, width only includes content. box-sizing: content-box (default).
In IE box model, width includes content + padding + border. box-sizing: border-box.
box-sizing: padding-box includes left&#x2F;right padding + width.




  Differences between Vue 2 and Vue 3


Two-way binding:
Vue 2: uses Object.defineProperty() (ES5), which only watches individual properties.
Vue 3: uses Proxy (ES6), which can observe entire objects and arrays.


Lifecycle hooks:
Vue 2: beforeCreate, created, beforeMount, mounted, etc.
Vue 3: setup, onBeforeMount, onMounted, etc.


Vue 2 requires a root tag; Vue 3 allows multiple root tags via Fragment.
API:
Vue 2: Options API (functions and data handled separately).
Vue 3: Composition API (related code grouped together).


Slots:
Named slot: Vue 2 uses slot=&quot;&quot;, Vue 3 uses v-slot=&quot;&quot;.
Scoped slot: Vue 2 uses slot-scope=&quot;data&quot;, Vue 3 uses #data or #default=&quot;&#123;data&#125;&quot;.

    <title>How to Prevent XSS</title>
    <url>/2025/10/17/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E9%98%B2%E5%BE%A1%20XSS%EF%BC%88%E8%B7%A8%E7%AB%99%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC%E6%94%BB%E5%87%BB%EF%BC%89/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[In web development, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is one of the most common and most dangerous security vulnerabilities.Once a website contains an XSS flaw, attackers may execute malicious scripts in users’ browsers, allowing them to steal cookies, hijack sessions, deface pages, or even take over user accounts.
This article explains how to effectively defend against XSS attacks from both a theoretical and practical perspective, covering frontend and full-stack security best practices.
1. What Is an XSS Attack?The essence of XSS is simple:

An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a webpage, which is then executed in other users’ browsers.

Common types of XSS attacks include:

Reflected XSS: malicious scripts are delivered through URL parameters
Stored XSS: malicious scripts are stored in a database and served to users
DOM-based XSS: frontend JavaScript logic directly handles untrusted data

No matter the type, the root cause is the same:👉 User input is treated as executable code.
2. Input Validation and Filtering (The Most Basic Defense)Never trust user input.
1. Basic Frontend ValidationOn the frontend, basic validation can improve user experience, such as:

Limiting input length
Enforcing input formats (e.g., email, phone numbers)
Filtering obviously dangerous characters

Example (for basic validation only):
function sanitizeInput(input) &#123;  return input.replace(/[&lt;&gt;]/g, &#x27;&#x27;);&#125;

⚠️ Important:Frontend validation is not a security boundary and should never be relied on alone.
2. Strict Backend Validation (Critical)Effective input validation must be performed on the server side:

Validate data types
Enforce length constraints
Reject inputs that violate business rules
Escape or sanitize HTML content using whitelists

Recommended principles:

Deny by default
Whitelist over blacklist

3. Output Encoding (More Important Than Input Filtering)Many XSS vulnerabilities occur not because input is unsafe, but because output is handled incorrectly.
1. HTML Escaping on OutputWhen rendering user input, always encode HTML characters:



Character
Escaped Form



&lt;
&amp;lt;


&gt;
&amp;gt;


&quot;
&amp;quot;


&#39;
&amp;#39;


Most modern template engines (Vue, React, Handlebars) escape output by default.Do not disable this behavior unless absolutely necessary.
2. Avoid Dangerous APIsAvoid patterns like:
element.innerHTML = userInput;

Safer alternatives include:
element.textContent = userInput;

Or:
const el = document.createElement(&#x27;div&#x27;);el.textContent = userInput;container.appendChild(el);



4. Use Safe APIs and Framework ProtectionsModern frontend frameworks include built-in XSS protections.
1. Default Protections in React and Vue
JSX and template syntax escape output by default
Dangerous APIs are explicitly labeled (e.g., v-html, dangerouslySetInnerHTML)

⚠️ If you use these APIs, you must ensure the content is 100% trusted.
2. Avoid String-Based HTML Construction❌ Unsafe example:
container.innerHTML = `&lt;div&gt;$&#123;userInput&#125;&lt;/div&gt;`;

✅ Safe alternative:
const div = document.createElement(&#x27;div&#x27;);div.textContent = userInput;container.appendChild(div);



5. Use Content Security Policy (CSP)Content Security Policy (CSP) is one of the most powerful defenses against XSS.
1. What CSP Can Do
Block inline script execution
Restrict allowed script sources
Prevent loading malicious third-party resources

Example HTTP header:
Content-Security-Policy:  default-src &#x27;self&#x27;;  script-src &#x27;self&#x27;;  object-src &#x27;none&#x27;;

Even if an attacker injects a script, CSP can prevent the browser from executing it.
2. Why CSP Is So ImportantBecause it provides:

Browser-level protection
A strong fallback even when application code has flaws

6. Use HttpOnly and Secure Cookies1. Purpose of HttpOnlyWhen setting cookies, add the HttpOnly flag:
Set-Cookie: sessionId=xxx; HttpOnly;

This prevents JavaScript from accessing cookies, reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
2. Combine with Secure and SameSiteFor stronger protection, also use:

Secure
SameSite=Strict or Lax

This significantly improves session security.
7. Keep Third-Party Libraries Up to DateIn real-world projects, many XSS vulnerabilities come from third-party dependencies:

Outdated UI components
Unmaintained plugins
Vulnerable npm packages

Best practices:

Update dependencies regularly
Use npm audit
Monitor security advisories

8. Develop Secure Coding HabitsPreventing XSS is not about a single technique, but about consistent habits:

Never trust external input
Avoid innerHTML unless necessary
Do not ignore security warnings
Prioritize security over convenience

9. Summary
XSS is one of the most common and dangerous web security threats
Effective protection requires frontend, backend, and browser-level defenses
Input validation is only the beginning—safe output handling and CSP are critical
Good security habits are more valuable than any single patch

For frontend developers,understanding how to prevent XSS is a key step toward true professionalism.

    <title>Fully Understanding How the JavaScript `new` Operator Works</title>
    <url>/2025/12/17/%E6%89%8B%E5%86%99New/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[In JavaScript, the new operator is a core concept that frequently appears in both interviews and everyday development.Many developers use new regularly, but few truly understand what actually happens behind the scenes.
In this article, we’ll implement new by hand, breaking down its internal mechanics step by step to help you fully understand how JavaScript objects are created.
1. What Does the new Operator Actually Do?When we execute the following line of code:
const person = new Person(&#x27;Alice&#x27;, 25);

JavaScript actually performs four steps internally:

Create a new empty object
Set the object’s prototype to the constructor’s prototype
Execute the constructor and bind this to the new object
If the constructor returns an object, return it; otherwise return the new object

Understanding these four steps is the key to understanding how new works.
2. Why Implement new Manually?There are three main benefits to handwriting new:

Deepens your understanding of the prototype chain and this binding
It is a high-frequency frontend interview question
Helps you understand how frameworks create objects internally

Let’s jump straight into the code.
3. Handwriting the new Operatorfunction myNew(constructor, ...args) &#123;  // 1. Create a new object and link its prototype  const obj = Object.create(constructor.prototype);  // 2. Execute the constructor with `this` bound to the new object  const result = constructor.apply(obj, args);  // 3. If the constructor returns an object, return it  //    Otherwise, return the newly created object  return result instanceof Object ? result : obj;&#125;

This implementation fully reproduces the core behavior of the new operator.
4. Line-by-Line Breakdown1. The Role of Object.createconst obj = Object.create(constructor.prototype);

This is equivalent to:
obj.__proto__ === constructor.prototype

Which means:

The new object can access methods on the constructor’s prototype
The prototype chain is properly established

2. constructor.apply(obj, args)const result = constructor.apply(obj, args);

This step does two things:

Executes the constructor function
Binds this inside the constructor to the new object

So code like this:
this.name = name;this.age = age;

Actually assigns properties directly to obj.
3. Why Do We Check the Return Value?return result instanceof Object ? result : obj;

This is a detail many developers overlook.
Consider this example:
function Test() &#123;  this.a = 1;  return &#123; b: 2 &#125;;&#125;const t = new Test();console.log(t); // &#123; b: 2 &#125;

If a constructor explicitly returns an object, the new operator returns that object instead of this.
That’s why we must handle this case in our myNew implementation.
5. Testing Our myNew Functionfunction Person(name, age) &#123;  this.name = name;  this.age = age;&#125;const p1 = myNew(Person, &#x27;Alice&#x27;, 25);console.log(p1.name); // Aliceconsole.log(p1.age);  // 25console.log(p1 instanceof Person); // true

The behavior matches native new perfectly.
6. Comparing myNew and Native new


Behavior
new
myNew



Create new object
✅
✅


Bind prototype
✅
✅


Bind this
✅
✅


Handle returned object
✅
✅


In practice, myNew reproduces about 90% of the real new operator’s behavior, which is more than sufficient for interviews and deep understanding.
7. Common Interview Follow-Up QuestionsQ1: Why not simply use const obj = &#123;&#125;?Because objects created with &#123;&#125; have their prototype set to Object.prototype.Objects created with new must have their prototype set to the constructor’s prototype.
Q2: Can constructor.apply be replaced with call?Yes. The only difference is how arguments are passed:
constructor.call(obj, ...args);



Q3: How does instanceof work?p1 instanceof Person

Internally, JavaScript checks whether:
Person.prototype exists in p1’s prototype chain



8. Summary
The new operator is not magic—it follows a well-defined execution process
Handwriting new is one of the best ways to understand prototype chains, this, and constructors
Mastering this concept helps when learning Vue, React, and Node.js internals

If you can both write and explain this implementation,90% of interviewers will consider your JavaScript fundamentals solid.

    <title>Reflections on *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*</title>
    <url>/2025/06/26/%E5%BD%93%E6%88%91%E8%B0%88%E8%B7%91%E6%AD%A5%E6%97%B6/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[What I Talk About When I Talk About RunningIt was through this book that I realized there could be another version of myself out there, doing something I love. Before reading this book, I had never read anything by Murakami. I knew he was popular and had many famous books, but I hadn’t really paid attention. But when it comes to running, I felt there could be a connection.
If I keep running, will I eventually reach the moon? Running isn’t about living longer, but about making life feel easier and lighter within the time we have.
I was surprised by Murakami’s imagination while running—so free and boundless. I really enjoy that. I’ve imagined many things too, like suddenly recalling a lyric while running—something like “speeding up to chase happiness,” blabla… Long-distance running requires endurance, but also imagination. Of course, the premise is loving to run. If someone doesn’t like running, no matter how much you say, it won’t matter. But if someone does love it, they’ll even want to meet another version of themselves during a break in the rain. Humans are inherently lonely, but the spirit can resonate with others.
I plan to keep running no matter how the world changes. Once, I walked 30 kilometers in one day. Despite the sunburn, I loved the spiritual fulfillment more. If you haven’t experienced it, you have no voice. Maybe I’m like Chen Kun—a pessimistic optimist. I live actively in this world, but I also see through its illusions. Neither joyful because of things, nor sorrowful because of myself.
My pulse has dropped to just over 50 beats per minute. Seems like I’m built for jogging. After all, it’s about interest. As long as my freedom isn’t restricted, anything is acceptable.
I hope next year I’ll join a marathon, with people cheering me on. That would be so happy.

“I’m not a person, but a pure machine. So I don’t need to feel anything, just keep running forward.”

What’s most similar is that we both love to run non-stop. Not the type who walks when tired or stops to enjoy the scenery. Maybe people have different views, but I think the true king is the one who can keep running without stopping.
When reaching the finish line, I’d feel so cool, a rush of pride, like winning the lottery or getting incredibly lucky. It’s a principle—and also my pride.
Oh, right—just like Brother Shang waiting at the finish line, and I’d smile proudly.

    <title>Handwriting Promise.race (From Theory to Practice)</title>
    <url>/2025/12/18/%E6%89%8B%E5%86%99Promise/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[In frontend interviews and daily development, Promise.race is a very common yet often overlooked API. Its rule is simple:

Multiple Promises “race” against each other—whichever settles first (fulfilled or rejected) determines the final result.

In this article, we will:

Clearly explain how Promise.race behaves and when to use it
Implement a custom myPromiseRace from scratch
Cover edge cases, optimizations, and common interview questions

1. What Is Promise.race?Promise.race(iterable) accepts an iterable (usually an array) and returns a new Promise:

If any Promise fulfills first, the returned Promise fulfills
If any Promise rejects first, the returned Promise rejects
It does not wait for all Promises to finish
It does not cancel the remaining Promises—they continue running

2. Common Use Cases2.1 Timeout Control (Most Common)For example, treat a request as failed if it takes longer than 3 seconds:

fetch(url) vs timeoutPromise(3000)
Whichever finishes first determines the result

2.2 Multiple Data Sources (Fallback Strategy)Fetch the same resource from multiple CDNs (CDN1&#x2F;CDN2).Use whichever responds first.
2.3 First-Render RacingLoad primary data, fallback data, and cached data simultaneously.Render the page as soon as the fastest result arrives.
3. Implementing myPromiseRaceThis implementation closely matches native behavior:

Validates that the input is iterable
Iterates over all inputs
Uses Promise.resolve to normalize non-Promise values
Resolves or rejects as soon as one Promise settles

function myPromiseRace(promises) &#123;  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; &#123;    // Validate iterable input    if (!promises || typeof promises[Symbol.iterator] !== &#x27;function&#x27;) &#123;      return reject(new TypeError(&#x27;Argument is not iterable&#x27;));    &#125;    // Iterate over each Promise or value    for (const promise of promises) &#123;      // Wrap with Promise.resolve to handle thenables and values      Promise.resolve(promise)        .then(resolve)   // First fulfilled wins        .catch(reject);  // First rejected wins    &#125;  &#125;);&#125;



4. Key Insight: Why Use Promise.resolve?The input to Promise.race does not have to be Promises. It may include:

Plain values: Promise.race([1, 2, 3])
Thenables: &#123; then(resolve) &#123; resolve(123) &#125; &#125;

Using Promise.resolve(x) ensures:

Plain values become immediately fulfilled Promises
Thenables are properly assimilated into the Promise chain

This behavior is consistent with the native Promise.race.
5. Handling Empty Iterables
Native Promise.race([]) returns a Promise that remains pending forever.

Your current implementation behaves the same way, since the loop never executes.This matches the ECMAScript specification.
You could add explicit handling, but it’s not required.
6. Additional Test Cases6.1 Rejection Wins Firstconst p1 = new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(() =&gt; res(&#x27;p1&#x27;), 1000));const p2 = new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(() =&gt; res(&#x27;p2&#x27;), 500));const p3 = new Promise((res, rej) =&gt; setTimeout(() =&gt; rej(&#x27;p3 error&#x27;), 300));myPromiseRace([p1, p2, p3])  .then(console.log)  .catch(console.error); // Output: p3 error



6.2 Plain Values Participate in the RacemyPromiseRace([  Promise.resolve(&#x27;A&#x27;),  123,  new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(() =&gt; res(&#x27;B&#x27;), 10))])  .then(console.log)  .catch(console.error);// Output: 123 (plain value wins immediately)



6.3 Empty Array Remains Pendingconst p = myPromiseRace([]);setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(&#x27;still pending...&#x27;), 1000);// After 1 second: &quot;still pending...&quot;



7. Practical Example: Request Timeout with racefunction timeout(ms) &#123;  return new Promise((_, reject) =&gt; &#123;    setTimeout(() =&gt; reject(new Error(`Timeout after $&#123;ms&#125;ms`)), ms);  &#125;);&#125;async function fetchWithTimeout(url, ms = 3000) &#123;  return myPromiseRace([fetch(url), timeout(ms)]);&#125;// UsagefetchWithTimeout(&#x27;https://example.com/api&#x27;, 2000)  .then(res =&gt; res.json())  .then(data =&gt; console.log(&#x27;data:&#x27;, data))  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(&#x27;error:&#x27;, err.message));



8. Common Interview Questions (Bonus Points)
Q: Can Promise.race cancel the other Promises?No. Promises are not cancellable by default. Cancellation requires tools like AbortController or custom logic.

Q: What happens if you pass a plain value into race?It is wrapped by Promise.resolve and usually wins immediately.

Q: What’s the difference between race, any, and allSettled?

race: settles as soon as the first Promise settles
any: fulfills as soon as the first Promise fulfills (rejects only if all reject)
allSettled: waits for all Promises and returns their final states



9. SummaryThe core idea behind implementing Promise.race can be summarized in one sentence:

Iterate over the iterable, wrap each item with Promise.resolve, attach the same resolve and reject, and let the first settled Promise decide the outcome.

    <content><![CDATA[Aunt TaiAunt Tai is strong-willed and resilient. Her optimistic attitude is something worth learning from. The greatest thing my father ever did was marrying my mother—a truly great woman. A real woman should face everything with positivity and build the future she desires with her own hands.
Although she resorted to stealing, it was driven by hardship—survival and family. Setting aside pride to do things against her will is, in a way, a form of strength. It’s not about crying and making a scene, but staying proactive in adversity.
Thinking about it, the author’s achievements are inseparable from his great mother.
Ah, that lovely mother! To preserve her husband’s dignity and happiness, she insisted on completing the house. Isn’t that a form of strength too? To follow her heart courageously is truly admirable.
In fact, the person who understands my father the most is my mother. She knows his pride. Isn’t this what love is? You don’t need to say it—I understand. I understand you, and you understand me, and that’s why we’ve been together for so long.
Zhang MeiliGet up from where you fell. Zhang Meili seems like someone who pursued true love and worked hard for what she desired. Though she was eventually forced to liberate herself sexually, I still respect her for everything she once did.
Public opinion is powerful, but Zhang Meili’s inner strength is even more powerful.

    <title>Encountering the Unknown Self</title>
    <url>/2025/06/30/%E9%81%87%E8%A7%81%E6%9C%AA%E7%9F%A5%E7%9A%84%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[Notes on Encountering the Unknown SelfWhat is the “Unknown”?The “self” refers to the “true self.” From the question “Who am I?” to the concept of “from existence to non-existence,” the entire book is structured around dialogues between Ruoling and a wise elder, revealing many profound life concepts.

Core Concepts
There is no one outside—only yourself.All external situations are actually projections of your inner world.

Golden Moments to Talk with the SubconsciousThe best times to imagine you’ve already achieved your goals are the moments between waking and sleeping—early morning just before fully waking up, or late at night before falling asleep. These times are when we are closest to our subconscious.

Key Practices: Awareness, Surrender, Overcoming the Peptide Self (Ego)

Awareness: Focus on your present self. Observe your emotions and reactions without judgment.
Surrender: Accept reality instead of resisting it.
Peptide Self (Ego): Represents inner voices of fear, comparison, and anxiety. Learn to recognize and transcend them.


Meditation, Gratitude, Giving

During meditation, visualize yourself already living your desired life.
Be grateful even before your goals are achieved.
Maintain a selfless, giving mindset.


Care Less About Others, Care More About Yourself

Bring your attention back to yourself and your inner world.
When emotions arise, be aware of which part of your body feels uncomfortable and understand its message.




ConclusionThis book is not only about discovering “who you are,” but also about reminding you to “become that true self.” Awakening inner strength requires continuous awareness, practice, and transcending the ego.
