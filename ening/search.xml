    <content><![CDATA[前端项目 GitLab CI&#x2F;CD 持续集成部署指南（Mac 环境）概要在日常开发过程中，我们经常需要将打包后的 dist 包手动发送给后端部署，效率低且容易出错。CI（Continuous Integration，持续集成）可以自动化这一过程，本文将介绍如何通过 GitLab CI 实现持续集成部署。

一、安装 GitLab Runner请参考官方文档：GitLab Runner 安装指南

二、本地注册 Runner
打开你的 GitLab 项目页面，进入 Settings → CI&#x2F;CD，展开 Runners 部分。
记住显示的 URL 和 token，用于后续注册。

执行注册命令gitlab-runner register

按照提示依次输入以下信息：

GitLab CI Coordinator URL: https://gitlab.com
GitLab CI Token: xxx（从项目中复制）
Tags: my-tag,another-tag（自定义）
Description: my-runner（自定义）
Executor: shell（Mac 上建议选择 shell）

注册完成后，回到 GitLab CI&#x2F;CD 设置页面，可看到 Runner 状态为绿色，说明已成功运行。如果不是绿色，请执行以下命令启动 Runner 服务：
gitlab-runner run


三、编写 .gitlab-ci.yml 文件并提交将以下内容保存为 .gitlab-ci.yml，并 push 到 GitLab：
stages:  - deploydeploy_to_test:  stage: deploy  script:    - yarn    - rm -rf dist/    - yarn build    - ls -l -t ./dist/    - rsync -avz ./dist/ root@xxx.xx.xx.xxx:/dist


这段 CI 脚本会自动打包项目，并使用 rsync 将 dist 目录部署到远程服务器。


四、通过 Docker 实现 CI（可选）如果需要通过 Docker 实现更完整的 CI&#x2F;CD 流程，继续以下步骤：
1. 安装 Docker（Mac）brew install --cask docker

2. 拉取 GitLab 镜像docker pull drud/gitlab-ce:v0.29.1

3. 创建 GitLab 容器docker run -d -p 8443:443 -p 8090:80 -p 8022:22 --restart always --name gitlab drud/gitlab-ce:v0.29.1

说明：

-p 8443:443：映射 HTTPS 端口
-p 8090:80：映射 HTTP 端口
-p 8022:22：映射 SSH 端口
--restart always：容器崩溃或主机重启时自动恢复
--name gitlab：容器命名为 gitlab

访问地址：
http://localhost:8090/


五、Docker 模式下的 .gitlab-ci.yml 示例variables:  TEST_NAME: &quot;tips&quot;  OUT_PORT: &quot;8081&quot;  IN_PORT: &quot;8081&quot;stages:  - deploydeploy_to_test:  stage: deploy  before_script:    - if [ $(docker ps -aq --filter name=$CI_PROJECT_NAME) ]; then docker rm -f $CI_PROJECT_NAME; fi  script:    - docker build -f Dockerfile -t $TEST_NAME:latest .    - docker run -d -p $OUT_PORT:$IN_PORT --name $TEST_NAME $TEST_NAME:latest

部署成功后，在 GitLab 的 CI&#x2F;CD Pipelines 页面可看到构建过程，在 Containers 页面会生成新容器，点击对应端口即可访问部署后的页面。

    <title>One Day You&#39;ll Understand - Reading Notes by Mr. Zhuomo</title>
    <url>/ening/2025/05/21/%E3%80%8A%E7%BB%88%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E5%A4%A9%E4%BD%A0%E4%BC%9A%E6%87%82%E3%80%8B%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%20-%20%E7%90%A2%E7%A3%A8%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[The book does contain a lot of his own “biases,” but I find him authentic and humorous. His language is simple and understandable, and each subtitle essentially tells us what we should do.
Understanding LifeLife is never about what you want it to be. It’s good to discover beauty and to view things from others’ perspectives. At the same time, one should have self-awareness.
Understanding LoveSheldon once said: “The pursuit of another human to spend life with is something I’ve never understood. Maybe I’m too interesting to need company. So I wish you the same joy with each other as I have with myself.”One can never escape loneliness through another person; only through passion for life. Managing a relationship requires rationality. Freedom is inalienable. I once checked my ex’s phone—I realized it was wrong and won’t do it again.
Understanding StrategyThis section mainly introduces the strategies of courting and how to maintain a good relationship—true wisdom. Never sacrifice your career for family. Don’t live with in-laws (though I think it depends). Have your own hobbies.
Understanding MarriageEndure and stay loyal. As for non-marriage beliefs, there’s nothing more to say.
Understanding SetbacksEvery breakup is just making way for true love. Don’t force it. I love you, so I wish you well, even if I’m not the one by your side.Do what you want regardless of others’ opinions. Only care about those who matter to you.
Understanding ReadingWhat, Why, How. Keep reading. Don’t chase speed, but depth.
Understanding RomanceHe shares sweet daily stories with his wife. If you don’t break up, you won’t discover how many better people there are out there. If you find one—lucky. If not—you can still live happily on your own.Live with emotional intelligence and the world becomes beautiful.
Understanding SocializingAssociate with decent people. Different people require different approaches. Rejecting others is an art. If you don’t have the guts to ask for your money back, don’t lend it.
Understanding Human NatureI tend to be skeptical about human nature. You can’t control others, so just manage yourself. Don’t be vulgar.
Understanding Good and EvilSome people enter your life just to teach you a lesson. Good or evil—I prefer believing in others, as trust is given before it’s earned.Even if deceived, it’s a lesson learned—don’t fall into the same trap again. But don’t stop trusting altogether; kind people still exist.God made the right hand a right hand as a reward; same for kind people—kindness is its own reward.I recall being in a restroom without tissue once. I was going to ask a friend, but a stranger overheard and handed me tissues. Such kindness moved me deeply.Kindness must come with principles—otherwise it may hurt others or yourself.
Understanding WealthThe poor stay poor because of narrow thinking. To get rich, don’t just invest in your body—think bigger. See the essence of problems.Time is limited—how to get rich fast? Find a subject you love, apply it, think broadly, and work in fields closely tied to society.
Understanding SocietyHave ambition. Take one step at a time. Build an independent personality. Be accountable for your actions. Learn to transform your ability to feel happiness—then change yourself.
Understanding Life and DeathDeath studies include concepts like: No death, no life; face death to live; understand death to be reborn. Interesting and thought-provoking.Knowing that we will die is what pushes us to live fully. When the time comes, I think I’ll embrace death.

What the world lacks isn’t perfect people, but justice, sincerity, courage, and compassion from the heart. — My biggest takeaway after watching Forever Young today.We all know cause and effect—but causes and effects come from relationships. Someday, I’ll read Schopenhauer and Nietzsche properly.

Understanding TravelThis part recounts Mr. Zhuomo’s experiences in Tibet. Many dream of going there—maybe because it helps people truly understand life’s struggles.The US is less disciplined than the UK. Japan has great food culture and says “sorry” a lot—avoiding bothering others.
Understanding CareerFirst learn to endure hardship. Then understand yourself and your talents. Begin with the end in mind and stay focused.
Understanding EducationEvery child is born pure. Without proper education, they won’t become pillars of the nation.
Understanding Entertainment &amp; FreedomLife has two paths: one for career ambition—keep passion; the other for living warmly—keep humanity.Open your eyes each day and tell yourself: Oh yeah!

    <title>Frontend Interview Questions</title>

    <content><![CDATA[
  Differences between var, let, and const?

✅ Scope
Variables declared with var do not have block scope. They can be accessed outside blocks but not outside functions.
Variables declared with let have block scope, accessible only within the declared block.
const defines constants, must be initialized, accessible only in the declared block, and cannot be reassigned.

✅ Declaration Rules
A variable name can only be declared once using one of these methods; otherwise, it throws an error.

✅ Difference when using with this


Feature
var &#x2F; let &#x2F; const



Can change this context
✅ Yes


First parameter is the object this refers to
✅ Yes


No object or undefined/null
Defaults to global window


Parameter passing
apply uses array, call uses parameter list, bind supports multiple arguments


Execution method
apply/call execute immediately, bind returns a new function





  What is event delegation?


Event delegation attaches events to a parent or ancestor element instead of individual child elements.
When the event reaches the target element, it bubbles up and triggers the handler on the outer element.




  Difference between debounce and throttle?


Debounce: Executes only the last trigger. Even if the event keeps firing, it waits until n seconds after the last event to execute.
Throttle: Controls the execution frequency. Fires every n seconds during continuous event triggers.




  How does frontend prevent SQL injection?


Parameterized Queries: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
Input Validation: Ensure user input follows expected format.
Escape Special Characters: Escape characters when constructing SQL queries.
Limit Permissions: Restrict user privileges to prevent unsafe operations.
Whitelist Validation: Only allow expected values in input.
Code Review: Regularly review code, especially DB-related parts.




  Difference between HTTP and HTTPS


HTTPS requires a certificate from a CA, which may cost money.
HTTP transmits data in plaintext, while HTTPS uses SSL encryption.
They use different connection methods and ports: HTTP uses 80, HTTPS uses 443.
HTTP is stateless; HTTPS combines SSL + HTTP for encrypted, authenticated, secure communication.




  Difference between created and mounted?


created runs before mounted. DOM is not fully rendered, but API requests can be made early here.
mounted is triggered when the DOM has been rendered, so it’s suitable for manipulating DOM elements.




  Explain the event loop mechanism

🔁 What is the Event Loop?JavaScript is single-threaded. In addition to the call stack, it relies on task queues to control asynchronous code execution order.
This whole process is called the Event Loop.
🧠 Core Concepts
Only one event loop in a single thread.
Multiple task queues:
Macro Tasks
Micro Tasks




⏱ Execution Order
Macro Task ➝ Clear all Micro Tasks ➝ Next Macro Task ➝ Clear all Micro Tasks…


Execute a macro task (like the whole script)
Execute all micro tasks created during this macro task
If micro tasks generate more micro tasks, execute them too
Begin the next macro task loop


🧩 Examples of Macro Tasks
script
setTimeout
setInterval
setImmediate (Node.js)
I/O operations
UI rendering

🧬 Examples of Micro Tasks
process.nextTick (Node.js, higher priority)
Promise.then / catch / finally
async / await
MutationObserver




  Explain the CSS box model

The CSS box model includes IE and standard W3C models.

In standard W3C box model, width only includes content. box-sizing: content-box (default).
In IE box model, width includes content + padding + border. box-sizing: border-box.
box-sizing: padding-box includes left&#x2F;right padding + width.




  Differences between Vue 2 and Vue 3


Two-way binding:
Vue 2: uses Object.defineProperty() (ES5), which only watches individual properties.
Vue 3: uses Proxy (ES6), which can observe entire objects and arrays.


Lifecycle hooks:
Vue 2: beforeCreate, created, beforeMount, mounted, etc.
Vue 3: setup, onBeforeMount, onMounted, etc.


Vue 2 requires a root tag; Vue 3 allows multiple root tags via Fragment.
API:
Vue 2: Options API (functions and data handled separately).
Vue 3: Composition API (related code grouped together).


Slots:
Named slot: Vue 2 uses slot=&quot;&quot;, Vue 3 uses v-slot=&quot;&quot;.
Scoped slot: Vue 2 uses slot-scope=&quot;data&quot;, Vue 3 uses #data or #default=&quot;&#123;data&#125;&quot;.

    <title>Reflections on *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*</title>

    <content><![CDATA[What I Talk About When I Talk About RunningIt was through this book that I realized there could be another version of myself out there, doing something I love. Before reading this book, I had never read anything by Murakami. I knew he was popular and had many famous books, but I hadn’t really paid attention. But when it comes to running, I felt there could be a connection.
If I keep running, will I eventually reach the moon? Running isn’t about living longer, but about making life feel easier and lighter within the time we have.
I was surprised by Murakami’s imagination while running—so free and boundless. I really enjoy that. I’ve imagined many things too, like suddenly recalling a lyric while running—something like “speeding up to chase happiness,” blabla… Long-distance running requires endurance, but also imagination. Of course, the premise is loving to run. If someone doesn’t like running, no matter how much you say, it won’t matter. But if someone does love it, they’ll even want to meet another version of themselves during a break in the rain. Humans are inherently lonely, but the spirit can resonate with others.
I plan to keep running no matter how the world changes. Once, I walked 30 kilometers in one day. Despite the sunburn, I loved the spiritual fulfillment more. If you haven’t experienced it, you have no voice. Maybe I’m like Chen Kun—a pessimistic optimist. I live actively in this world, but I also see through its illusions. Neither joyful because of things, nor sorrowful because of myself.
My pulse has dropped to just over 50 beats per minute. Seems like I’m built for jogging. After all, it’s about interest. As long as my freedom isn’t restricted, anything is acceptable.
I hope next year I’ll join a marathon, with people cheering me on. That would be so happy.

“I’m not a person, but a pure machine. So I don’t need to feel anything, just keep running forward.”

What’s most similar is that we both love to run non-stop. Not the type who walks when tired or stops to enjoy the scenery. Maybe people have different views, but I think the true king is the one who can keep running without stopping.
When reaching the finish line, I’d feel so cool, a rush of pride, like winning the lottery or getting incredibly lucky. It’s a principle—and also my pride.
Oh, right—just like Brother Shang waiting at the finish line, and I’d smile proudly.

    <content><![CDATA[Aunt TaiAunt Tai is strong-willed and resilient. Her optimistic attitude is something worth learning from. The greatest thing my father ever did was marrying my mother—a truly great woman. A real woman should face everything with positivity and build the future she desires with her own hands.
Although she resorted to stealing, it was driven by hardship—survival and family. Setting aside pride to do things against her will is, in a way, a form of strength. It’s not about crying and making a scene, but staying proactive in adversity.
Thinking about it, the author’s achievements are inseparable from his great mother.
Ah, that lovely mother! To preserve her husband’s dignity and happiness, she insisted on completing the house. Isn’t that a form of strength too? To follow her heart courageously is truly admirable.
In fact, the person who understands my father the most is my mother. She knows his pride. Isn’t this what love is? You don’t need to say it—I understand. I understand you, and you understand me, and that’s why we’ve been together for so long.
Zhang MeiliGet up from where you fell. Zhang Meili seems like someone who pursued true love and worked hard for what she desired. Though she was eventually forced to liberate herself sexually, I still respect her for everything she once did.
Public opinion is powerful, but Zhang Meili’s inner strength is even more powerful.
